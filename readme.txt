### Why AI Related Products for WooCommerce?
* We have built an AI Related Products Widget for Elementor. 
* We have built shortcode for the classical editor. It can be used in any editor.
* We have built an AI Related Products Block for Gutenberg. 
* In a single product page, you can replace the random related products with the related products in which your clients are interested.
* The layout of the products list will be the same as your shop page's layout for the product list. As a result, design doesn't require additional work.
